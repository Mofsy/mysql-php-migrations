MySQL-PHP-Migrations is strictly a command-line tool for managing database migrations for PHP/MySQL projects.  It should work from any command-line (Linux, Mac, Windows), but has only been tested from a Mac command line using a custom-compiled PHP setup.  Basic requirements are as follows:

  * PHP 5.2.1+ (with CLI)
  * PDO Extension for PHP with MySQL driver
  * MySQL 4.1+
  * username (and password) for the MySQL database
